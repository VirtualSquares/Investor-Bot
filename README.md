Simple trading algorithm that checks for percent drop and gains in stocks and visually represents them using matplotlib, while also reccomending if it's a good time to buy/sell. 
Will definitely update soon, hoping to integrate it into a website and incorporate web scraping to check for new product releases, big statements, etc.
